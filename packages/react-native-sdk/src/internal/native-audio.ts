/**
 * The platform capabilities call-audio routing depends on.
 *
 * # Why this is an interface and not a direct dependency
 *
 * Raven used to get audio routing from `@livekit/react-native`'s
 * `AudioSession`, which crammed session management, output selection,
 * device enumeration and the iOS route picker into one native module. No
 * single upstream package does all of that. `react-native-incall-manager`
 * handles session management and output selection well, does device
 * enumeration on Android only, and doesn't implement the iOS route picker
 * at all.
 *
 * So rather than pretend otherwise: the pieces the platform genuinely
 * can't do are `undefined` here, `audio.ts` reports them as
 * `NOT_SUPPORTED`, and an app needing full fidelity supplies its own
 * adapter through `audio.setAdapter`, wrapping whatever native module it
 * already has (an `AVRoutePickerView` bridge, say). A real limitation,
 * stated out loud instead of hidden. See
 * docs/sdk/react-native.md#audio-routing.
