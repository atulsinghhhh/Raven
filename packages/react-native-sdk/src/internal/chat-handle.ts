/**
 * Builds `raven.chat` on top of `@corvidhq/chat`'s real client.
 *
 * Two things about this file are worth knowing.
 *
 * First, `@corvidhq/chat` is **resolved at runtime**, never imported
 * statically. It's an optional peer dependency. An app that only wants
 * video shouldn't be forced to bundle a messaging client, and a static
 * import makes it mandatory at bundle time whether or not `chatToken` was
 * ever set.
 *
 * Second, what comes back is the client itself with two methods layered on
 * top. Not a wrapper that re-implements or re-exports the API.
 * `chat.on(...)`, `chat.messages.list(...)`, `chat.startTyping()` and the
 * rest are the same functions a web app calls, so the chat documentation
 * applies verbatim on mobile (spec §5, no mobile-specific chat protocol).
