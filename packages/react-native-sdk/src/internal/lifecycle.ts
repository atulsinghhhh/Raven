 * the app goes into the background. On both platforms a backgrounded app
 * with a live audio session keeps running, and dropping the socket turns
 * "switched to Messages for four seconds" into "left the meeting". Video
 * capture is the thing that actually stops: iOS suspends the camera, and
 * Android does the same without a foreground service. So the useful move
 * on return is re-checking state, not reconnecting.
 *
 * Anything more aggressive belongs to the app, not the SDK. Whether a
 * backgrounded user should stay in the room is a product decision, and
 * deciding it here takes it away from the developer.
