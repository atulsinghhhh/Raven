/**
 * Installs the WebRTC globals React Native doesn't ship with.
 *
 * This one function is the entire reason `@corvidhq/rtc`, a package written
 * for browsers, runs unmodified on a phone. `registerGlobals()` drops
 * `RTCPeerConnection`, `navigator.mediaDevices`, `MediaStream` and the rest
 * onto the global object, backed by the native iOS and Android WebRTC
 * implementation in `react-native-webrtc`. After that, nothing in
 * `@corvidhq/rtc` can tell it isn't in a browser.
 *
 * It matters more since Raven's own SFU replaced LiveKit. The web SDK now
 * drives `RTCPeerConnection` directly rather than handing off to a client
 * library, so what it wants from the platform is precisely the standard
 * WebRTC API. Which is precisely what `react-native-webrtc` gives it.
 *
 * And that's the whole architecture of this package. Raven's RTC and chat
 * logic is shared with web, and only what genuinely differs lives here:
 * rendering, permissions, app lifecycle, audio routing.
 *
 * Has to run before any Raven client is constructed, and exactly once.
 * `new Raven(...)` calls it for you so nobody has to remember. Calling it
 * yourself earlier, in `index.js` before the first render, is supported and
 * occasionally handy.

 * Rather than declare a version floor we don't otherwise need, just fill
