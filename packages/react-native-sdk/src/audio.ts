 * user has AirPods in is worse. The OS also reroutes underneath you when a
 * headset gets plugged in, a call comes through, or Bluetooth connects.
 *
 * `Raven` starts and stops the audio session around a room for you, so the
 * default behaviour is right without any of this being called. This module
 * is for when the app wants to override it, a speakerphone button being
 * the obvious case.
 *
 * # What's actually behind this
 *
 * Raven doesn't bundle an audio-session implementation any more. The
 * default adapter goes through `react-native-incall-manager`, an optional
 * peer dependency, and `setAdapter()` swaps it out. Two methods,
 * `getOutputs()` and `showRoutePicker()`, have no upstream implementation
 * at all and report `NOT_SUPPORTED` unless an adapter supplies them.
 * docs/sdk/react-native.md#audio-routing covers why, and what to do if you
 * need them.
