 * Mobile brings exactly one failure mode the web SDK doesn't have: an

 * Everything else already has a code in `@ravenkash/rtc`: expired tokens,
 * failed connections, missing rooms, unavailable devices. Reusing those is
 * the entire point. Someone moving from web to mobile should be catching
 * the same `RTCError` with the same `code`, not learning a second error
 * vocabulary (Phase 13 spec §14).
 *
 * So what this file adds is a subclass carrying extra mobile-specific
 * context, not a new hierarchy. `RavenPermissionError` *is* an `RTCError`,
 * and existing `catch (e) { if (isRTCError(e)) ... }` code carries on
 * working untouched.
