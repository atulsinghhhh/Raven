/**
 * `raven chat`. Inspection only, and that's deliberate.
 *
 * The CLI authenticates with a developer's session, the same JWT the
 * dashboard uses, and every command in here reads a dashboard-facing
 * endpoint. Sending a message or minting a chat token needs a *project API
 * key*, which is a runtime credential your backend holds. Not something the
 * CLI should store, or encourage anyone to paste into a terminal.
 *
 * Which is why there's no `raven chat send`. Use `@ravenkash/server` or
 * `raven-sdk` from your backend for that. See docs/cli.md#chat.
