/**
 * Identity stand-in for `chalk`.
 *
 * Two reasons this is a stub rather than a transform of the real package:
 *
 * 1. chalk@5 is ESM-only and imports `#ansi-styles`, a subpath import
 *    Jest's CommonJS transform cannot resolve. Every suite importing a
 *    module that touches chalk failed to parse at all.
 * 2. These tests assert on the *text* the CLI prints. Real ANSI escapes
 *    would make every expected string unreadable and dependent on
 *    whether the runner thinks it has a colour terminal.
 *
 * So colour is a no-op here and assertions read as plain strings.
