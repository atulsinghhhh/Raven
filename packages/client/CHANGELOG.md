### Patch Changes

- [#40](https://github.com/atulsinghhhh/Raven/pull/40) [`d7f48ea`](https://github.com/atulsinghhhh/Raven/commit/d7f48ea4294a36c7fd6d60ebff0f5b32820101e9) Thanks [@atulsinghhhh](https://github.com/atulsinghhhh)! - `@ravenkash/rtc` and `@ravenkash/client` are installable again.

  Both shipped at 0.1.0 with the workspace protocol still in their published
  manifests — `"@ravenkash/effects": "workspace:*"` for `rtc`, plus
  `"@ravenkash/chat"` and `"@ravenkash/rtc"` for `client`. The packages were
  public and downloadable the whole time; they just could not be installed by
  anyone outside this repo:

  ```
  npm  install @ravenkash/rtc → EUNSUPPORTEDPROTOCOL Unsupported URL Type "workspace:"
  pnpm add     @ravenkash/rtc → ERR_PNPM_WORKSPACE_PKG_NOT_FOUND @ravenkash/effects@workspace:*
  ```

  That made step 2 of the documented quickstart — `npm install @ravenkash/rtc`
  — impossible to follow, while `@ravenkash/server` installed fine, so the
  break only showed up once a developer got as far as the browser half.

  No source change was needed: `workspace:*` is correct in the repo, and pnpm
  rewrites it to a concrete version when it packs. The 0.1.0 tarballs were
  published by hand with `npm publish`, which rewrites nothing and bypassed
  every gate in `.github/workflows/release.yml`. Three gates now cover that
  path — a `prepublishOnly` guard in each package that refuses an npm-driven
  publish, a packed-tarball inspection that reads the manifest npm would
  actually receive, and a metadata check that fails a package using the
  protocol without the guard wired up.

  0.1.0 stays on the registry as-is; npm unpublish is restricted to 72 hours
  and that window is long closed. Anyone stuck on it can use an npm
  `overrides` entry pinning `@ravenkash/effects` to `0.1.0` until 0.1.1 lands.
