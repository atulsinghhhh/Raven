 * what to send when a publisher mutes. That's worth testing without
 * dragging in a browser, so this supplies the bare minimum of both APIs
 * and exposes the seams a test needs to drive it.
 *
 * What it very by design doesn't do is simulate media. Nothing here
 * encodes, forwards or transports a single byte. Whether media actually
 * flows is settled by the SFU's own tests, which run real Pion
 * PeerConnections against a real forwarding path; see

 * us a test that passes while the product is broken, which is worse than
