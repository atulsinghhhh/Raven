 * publishing needs a delegate it can hand an `RTCRtpSender` to, and a

 * so publishing, muting, stats, effects and device switching all behave
 * exactly as they do for a captured track — with no loosening of what
 * `publish()` accepts.
 *
 * Raven does not own this track's lifetime: it never called
 * `getUserMedia`, so stopping the canvas, the oscillator or the file is
 * the application's business. `unpublish()` still stops the track, in
