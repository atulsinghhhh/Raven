/**
 * The simulcast ladder, and the checks that prove it reached the wire.
 *
 * # Why this is its own module
 *
 * Simulcast was configured in this SDK for a long time without ever being
 * sent. `applySimulcast()` called `addTrack()` and then tried to attach
 * three encodings with `setParameters()`, which the WebRTC specification
 * requires implementations to reject — the number of encodings on a sender
 * is fixed once the sender exists. RIDs also only appear in the SDP
 * (`a=simulcast:send`, `a=rid:`) when they were present *before* the offer
 * was generated, which `setParameters` is by definition too late for. The
 * rejection went to `logger.debug` and nothing else, so every publisher in
 * every room sent one full-resolution layer while the code believed it was
 * sending three.
 *
 * What made it survive was that there was nowhere to look. "Simulcast is
 * on" was a claim about an array in memory, and an array in memory is
 * exactly what a broken implementation has too. So the verification here
 * deliberately reads the two things a broken implementation cannot fake:
 * the sender's *negotiated* parameters, and the local SDP.

 *
 * Kept identical to the Flutter SDK's
 * (`sdks/flutter/raven_rtc/lib/src/internal/engine.dart`). The RIDs in
 * particular are not labels — they travel in an RTP header extension on
 * every packet and the SFU maps them straight onto its own layer names
 * (`services/sfu/internal/room/downtrack.go`, `layerFromRID`). A RID that
