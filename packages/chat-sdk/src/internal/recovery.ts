/**
 * Remembers where each room got to, and replays what was missed.
 *
 * ## Why a cursor per room and not one per connection
 *
 * A connection is subscribed to several conversations at once and they
 * advance at completely different rates. One shared resume point would be
 * pinned to whichever room was quietest, so every reconnect would re-read
 * the busy rooms from far too early — correct, thanks to de-duplication,
 * but wasteful in exactly the case that matters. Rooms are independent
 * here, and one room failing to recover does not stop the others.
 *
 * ## Why the server's cursor rather than a local timestamp
 *
 * `createdAt` alone is not unique — two messages can land in the same
 * millisecond, and resuming from a bare timestamp either skips one or
 * repeats it depending on which comparison you pick. The cursor the server
 * puts on every message is the `(createdAt, publicId)` pair the history
 * endpoint already paginates on, so resuming is the same indexed seek as
 * an ordinary page and cannot land between two messages.
 *
 * It is also a *value*, not a reference to a row, so it survives the
 * message it names being deleted or aged out by retention. That is what
 * makes it safe to hold across a long offline period.
 *
 * ## What this is not
 *
 * Client recovery state, and nothing more. The server keeps no per-client
 * position, learns nothing when a client catches up, and behaves
 * identically whether or not anybody ever reconnects. Postgres stays the
 * only record of what was said.
