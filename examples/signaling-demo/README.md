# Signaling Demo

A single static HTML file (`index.html`, no build step, no dependencies)
that demonstrates the Phase 3 signaling layer end-to-end: connect,
authenticate, join a room, see participant events, exchange placeholder
SDP/ICE messages, and disconnect. It does **not** establish real media —
see `docs/rtc/architecture.md` for why that's intentionally out of scope until
Phase 4.

## Running it

1. Make sure the stack is running: `pnpm infra:up` (from the repo root).
2. Get two RTC tokens for the same room. Fastest way — seed demo data
   and mint tokens against the seeded room:

   ```bash
   pnpm db:seed   # prints a demo project/API key/room
   curl -X POST http://localhost:4100/v1/rooms/<roomId>/rtc-tokens \
     -H "Authorization: Bearer <api-key-from-seed>" \
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
     -d '{"participantIdentity":"alice","permissions":{"join":true,"subscribe":true,"publish":true}}'
   ```

   Run it again with `"participantIdentity":"bob"` for a second token.
   Or use the Swagger UI at `http://localhost:4100/docs` instead of curl.

3. Open `index.html` directly in two browser tabs (double-click it, or
   `open index.html` — no server needed, `file://` works fine since the
   page only ever talks to the signaling WebSocket directly).
4. In tab 1: paste alice's token, click **Connect**, then **room.join**.
5. In tab 2: paste bob's token, click **Connect**, then **room.join**.
   Tab 1 should show a `participant.joined` event for bob.
6. Try **Send sdp.offer** / **Send sdp.answer** / **Send ice.candidate**
   in either tab (target the other participant's ID, shown in the
   Participants list) — the message log shows the exact frames sent and
   received.
7. Click **Disconnect** in either tab — the other tab receives
   `participant.left`.

See `docs/rtc/signaling.md` for the full message reference.
