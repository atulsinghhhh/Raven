Fix RavenLiveStream losing a participant under React Strict Mode's dev-only double-invoke

Reported as: two browsers, one host live-streaming, one viewer joining —
the viewer's browser never showed the host's video. Reproduced against a
real external-developer app built on the published `@ravenkash/*`
packages, running its normal `next dev` server.

Root cause: React Strict Mode (on by default in Next.js dev builds)
mounts `RavenLiveStream`'s join effect, runs its cleanup, then mounts it
again, before the first `joinLiveStream()` call resolves. The effect
called `joinLiveStream()` unconditionally in both invocations, so the
server briefly saw two live sessions claiming the same identity. Confirmed
at the raw WebRTC level: two `RTCPeerConnection`s were created per client,
one stuck at `connecting` forever. The surviving connection's own
`RTCPeerConnection` completed ICE and genuinely received the host's media
(`ontrack` fired for both audio and video), but the Room's participant
state never reflected them — media flowed, but no participant ever
appeared.

Each effect invocation's join now chains onto a ref-held promise that only
resolves once the *previous* invocation has fully settled (its join
result attached, or left if it was already cancelled). A ref survives
Strict Mode's mount → cleanup → mount because it's the same component
instance both times, so this guarantees at most one live join per
`<RavenLiveStream>` instance — in the common case (cleanup runs
synchronously, before any microtask), the abandoned invocation's
`joinLiveStream()` call is skipped entirely rather than merely torn down
after the fact.

This only ever affected local development (Strict Mode's double-invoke is
dev-only) — production builds were never affected.
