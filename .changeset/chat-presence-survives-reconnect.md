Re-assert presence after a reconnect

Presence is socket state. A reconnect opens a new socket, which knows
nothing of what was set on the old one, and `syncRooms()` re-joined the
rooms without re-sending the status — so a client that survived a blip
went silently invisible to everybody else for the rest of the session
while its own `connectionState` still read `connected`. Two people in a
conversation could each see only themselves, with nothing anywhere to say
why.

`setPresence()` now remembers what it was asked for and `syncRooms()`
re-sends it, ahead of the rejoins so the server never processes a join
for somebody it currently believes is absent. Nothing is sent for a
client that never called `setPresence()`: announcing a status nobody
chose would invent one, and would make a deliberately invisible client —
a moderation view, a bot, an agent watching a queue — impossible to
build.

The same fix ships in `raven_chat` for Flutter, which had the identical
defect.
