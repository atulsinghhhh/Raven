/// from becoming an infinite reconnect loop: a client that can never
/// reconnect should stop and report failure, not hammer a server that is
/// already having a bad day.
///
/// Jitter is not decoration. When a gateway restarts, every client it was
/// holding wakes at the same instant; without jitter they retry in
/// lockstep and recreate the thundering herd on every attempt. Full
/// jitter — a uniform pick inside the window — spreads them out.
///
/// This matters more on mobile than on the web: a cell handover or a lift
/// disconnects thousands of clients simultaneously in a way a browser tab
/// rarely does.
