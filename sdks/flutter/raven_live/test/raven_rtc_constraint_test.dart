/// track arrives after the tile was built — which is every live stream,
/// since a viewer's tile is built before the host's media reaches them.
/// The connection underneath is healthy the whole time (it decodes real
/// RTP), so nothing short of looking at the rendered surface catches it,
/// and no test inside this package can: the defect and its fix both live
/// in `raven_rtc`. What this package *can* get wrong, silently, is
/// declaring a constraint that excludes the fix.
///
/// It nearly did. `^0.1.8` reads like "0.1.8 or newer" and means
/// `>=0.1.8 <0.2.0` to pub, so publishing the fix as `raven_rtc` 0.2.0
/// would have left every `raven_live` application resolving a version
/// that cannot show a viewer anything.
