/// natively, so both SDKs classify a tile the same way without one of them
/// having to guess at a pixel ratio.

/// while that happens. Falling is cheap by comparison, and the penalty for
/// falling too eagerly is a moment of softness. So the margin is applied
/// upwards only — a tile has to genuinely grow to ask for more, but drops
/// as soon as it is really smaller.
