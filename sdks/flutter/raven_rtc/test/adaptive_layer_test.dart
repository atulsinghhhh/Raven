/// Worth testing on its own rather than only through the widget, because
/// the interesting behaviour is not "which layer for which width" — that is
/// a lookup — but what happens at the boundaries, where a naive threshold
/// oscillates. Every flip costs a real layer switch at the SFU: it waits
/// for a keyframe on the new layer and asks the publisher for one, and the
/// tile visibly stutters while that happens.
