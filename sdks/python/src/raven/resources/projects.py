"""An API key is already permanently scoped to exactly one project (Phase 10
spec Section 2/14) — there is nothing to list/create/update/delete here.
Those remain human/dashboard-session operations, not something a server API
key can or should do. ``get()`` takes no arguments: it always returns the one
project this key belongs to.
