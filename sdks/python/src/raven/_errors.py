"""The one error type this SDK raises.

Built purely from the parsed response body (``{"message": ..., "code": ...}``,
matching ``AppError`` on the Raven API side) plus response metadata — never
from anything that could carry the API key, so there is no path by which a
key could end up here. Never includes a stack trace from the server, a
database error, or TURN/RTC credentials (Phase 10 spec Section 10).
